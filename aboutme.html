            I was born as Michael Nava, no middle name. Currently, I am a 17 years old; I have dark curly hair, a trimmed beard, brown eyes, brown skin, and a lean body. 
            I am in Cross Country, one of the most underrated sports out there. I have two beautiful, cute little dogs named Jojo and Kira.

        <center><p>
            <ol>
                <li>I like to play guitar on my free time.I <em>love</em> rock music, especially of the early 2000s. My favorite bands are Green Day and Foo Fighters. In my free time I jam out and headbang to their music in my room, playing along with my electric guitar. I have always wanted to be in a band and this is the closest thing I can get to playing with one live.</li>
                <li>After school, I have practice <em>every. single. day.</em> I'm in one of the hardest sports you can imagine: Cross Country. Not many people know what it's about and some people don't even know it exists. We run miles after miles for practice. As my coach would say, "Our practice is your workout." We have a race every other week, in races we line up in rows by school, and sometimes there can be as many as over 120 people at the starting line! We're expected to run a 5k (3 miles) as fast as we physically, possibly can. Don't get me started on how it <em>feels</em> to be in a race. The pain, the excitement, the dread, the ringing in your ears of the deafening voices cheering you on. Oh, and sometimes you're all alone, in pain, with no one pushing you but yourself. In moments like those you learn to respect the man or woman to your left and to your right. You make a bond through the burden that you both carry on your shoulders.
                <li>I also like dogs.

            I am an AP student and have always enrolled in the hardest classes that would challenge me. Currently I am taking 3 AP Classes (4 if my schedule would have allowed me). I have passed every AP test I have ever taken.

        <h4><u>Music</u></h4>
        <p>
            In my early childhood I grew up sitting in the backseat of my dad's old business car listening to classic rock on the radio. I woud lie down on the cushioned seats and stare up, out the window and watch as the streetlights flashed by in beat. Although I did not pay much attention to it at the time, classic rock would be a corner stone and define much of my character later in life. The first time I discovered and liked music on my own was when my older sister, Katherine, gave me her red iPod. You know those old iPods with the buttons and the tiny, box screen. I went through her songs and I came across two that stood out to me: "Best of You" by <em>Foo Fighters</em> and "Wake Me Up When September Ends" by <em>Green Day</em>. Those songs were the hit at the time in the early 2000s. My favorite taste in music is stuck and centered on Rock from that time. I can appreciate good music from today when I hear it, or from decades previous, but only music from that time or music that sounds like it can really get me going and touch my heart. I also had a classical music phase when I joined band in the 8th grade. It came hand in hand with the beginning of my obsession with movies. I began to appreciate movie music more and in turn, I appreciated the power and sound that an orchestra can produce and how they can make you feel. Today, as in the moment that I had written this document, my favorite classical piece would probably be "Waltz of the Flowers" from <em>The Nutcracker</em>, written by Tchaikovsky.

        <h4><u>Movies</u></h4>
        <p>
            I am an avid movie fan. Movies and books are what made me who I am. They tell the most amazing stories and give the best life lessons. They teach us and show us how to feel, how to act, and how to be. Through only visuals and sounds they can do so much; it's amazing what they can do. I grew up in what I consider to be the highlight of movie history. In the late 90s and early 2000s the most memorable, classic, modern movies were being released at the time. Movies such as <em>Silence of the Lambs, Mr. Nobody, Gladiator, Inception, The Dark Knight, The Shawshank Redemption, Shindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, Forrest Gump, Toy Story, </em> and many more. It was also the time of pioneering one of the three best trilogies of all time: <em>The Matrix, Pirates of the Caribbean,</em> and <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>. You may not agree with all the movies in that list, but tell me, does anyone not know the "He's a Pirate" tune? Does anyone not know the iconic slow-motion action scenes from <em>The Matrix</em>? Did <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> not win 11 out of 12 of the Oscars it was nominated for? A record that I might add has not been beaten to this day. These spectacular movies taught me so many things about life, how the world works, why people do the things they do. They taught me way more about society and the world we live in, dreams and the reality we try to shape, war and the history we repeat, all way better and more than any grade school taught me. I did not see <em>Saving Private Ryan</em> and think "Wow! I want to shoot people and be in war!" No, I saw how horrible it all really is. I learned to appreciate life and to use force only when necessary. 
        <p>
            When I grew older I saw more movies from before my time such as <em>The Karate Kid</em> and <em>Star Wars</em> (the prequels are mostly good mind you. <em>Episode III: Revenge of the Sith</em> is a cinematic masterpiece and ties so many loose ends and fully makes the saga come full circle perfectly). I saw the world our ancestors left behind through many lens, through many perspectives. Each movies was a person telling their own story, their own perspective of events and how things happened. I found that many movies would be about the same topic but end in different opinions. This understanding lead to me being the open minded and understanding person I am today. I do not think there is one correct absolute correct answer in everything. Just because you're right, doesn't mean you're <em>right</em>. Not every person who was born just decided one day that they wanted to be evil. Often times, the "bad guy" is someone just like you and me who doing whatever they can in what they believe is to be good. In some other person's perspective somewhere out there, you're a monster, and in someone else's, you're a hero.
